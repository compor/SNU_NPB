# NAS Parallel Benchmarks

This repo contains the source code for the [NAS][1] Parallel Benchmarks [implemented in C][2].
Currently, this includes the serial and OMP parallel versions.

The main modifications performed in preparation for usage with [this][3] build harness were:

-   move each program source to a `src` subdirectory
-   remove existing build files (for `make` and `cmake`)
